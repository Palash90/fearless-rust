~~Write a test~~

Write a Temparature Conversion Program
	Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table. 
	Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table. 
	Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.
	Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section to use a function for conversion.

Write an integer power program

Write a function to generate random numbers

Write a recursive factorial function. Limit input to the max supported by machine.

Write a character array with static length
	
Write a Squeeze function on String
	
Write a StrCat Program to concatenate two strings
	
Write a Program to make uppercase of string
	
Write a program to reverse a string

Write a File Copy Program. Copy from file to STD OUT and to a new File.
	Write a new File Creation Program which takes input from STD IN and write to a file.
	Write a character counting program
	Write a line counting program
	Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines. 

Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank. 
	Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way. 

Write a word counting program
	Write a word histogram program
	Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging. 
	Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input.

Write a function htoi(s), which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional 0x or 0X) into its equivalent integer value. The allowable digits are 0 through 9, a through f, and A through F.

Write the function itob(n,s,b) that converts the integer n into a base b character representation in the string s. In particular, itob(n,s,16) formats s as a hexadecimal integer in s. // Introduce Rust Strings in this program.
	
Exercise 3-3. Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in the string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2. Allow for letters of either case and digits, and be prepared to handle cases like a-b-c and a-z0-9 and -a-z. Arrange that a leading or trailing - is taken literally. 

Exercise 4-1. Write the function strindex(s,t) which returns the position of the rightmost occurrence of t in s, or None if there is none. 

Project Idea
============

1. Expression calculator using Stack. Start from LinkedList and build upto Stack and then use it to write the calculator. Add functions, if else etc.
